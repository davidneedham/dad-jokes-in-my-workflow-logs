# Dad Jokes In My Workflow Logs #

This Pantheon Quicksilver script curls in a dad joke from https://icanhazdadjoke.com and echoes it into your Pantheon workflow logs.  

## Instructions ##

1. Add either the dad-jokes-in-my-workflow-logs.php to the `private/scripts` directory of your code repository.
2. Add a Quicksilver operation to your `pantheon.yml` to fire the script a deploy (see example below).
3. Test a deploy out!

You will want to use the [`terminus workflows watch`](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/commands/) command to see this in action

### Example `pantheon.yml` ###

Here's an example of what your `pantheon.yml` would look like if this were the only Quicksilver operation you wanted to use.  Pick and choose the exact workflows that you would like to see notifications for.

```yaml
api_version: 1

workflows:
  deploy_product:
    after:
        - type: webphp

          script: private/scripts/dad-jokes-in-my-workflow-logs.php
  create_cloud_development_environment:
